                            HireBeat is seeking a <b>UI Design Intern</b> to create simple, elegant, and intuitive interactive
                            interfaces for our core web product: AI-driven and function-heavy Saas product. As a UI Design
                            Intern, you will work with Product Management, Engineering, Business, to push boundaries,
                            build great products, and solve customer problems. Candidates should show an impressive background
                            with interface design, as well as interest and consideration for experience, and user-centered design.
                            This role is focused on visual interactive interface design: how users interact with devices,
                            how users process information, and ultimately how HireBeat’s product “look” and “feel”.
                            Core to this role is the creation of the final “pixel-perfect” UI that users experience,
                            and in creating UI, illustration, and micro animation in a visually systematic way that ensures
                            a holistic, consistent experience across our products.
                        </p>
