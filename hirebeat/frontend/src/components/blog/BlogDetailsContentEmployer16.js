                                    Your company is the result of your absolute hard work. Taking only the right team members on board is crucial to keep it on its glorious path of success. According to Career Builder, hiring the wrong candidate has cost about 74% of the companies the loss of about $14,900 per hire. Choosing a single person from hundreds of applicants for a job is like finding a needle in a haystack. But identifying the red flags during an interview gives the recruiting team an upper hand over the choice they make.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Here are some critical red flags that should not be avoided at any cost.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">Arriving Unprepared</h3>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                    A candidate appearing late on the premises, dressing inappropriately, with incomplete documents shows their lack of time management and irresponsible behavior. A person who did not do their research ahead of time and has limited interests in your company would hesitate and stare at you blankly a lot. Hiring such individuals is putting your company at risk since they won’t be able to complete the given tasks on time and are not “thrilled” to work for you.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">Irregular Work Record</h3>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                    It’s the loud alarming signal if the candidate has switched from jobs to jobs quite fast in a short span of their working career. This shows that they either cannot adjust to a place or cannot work responsibly or get bored quickly with the task at hand and start looking for better opportunities.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">Poor Communication Skills</h3>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                    A business’s success is all about excellent communication. If a candidate shows a lack of good speaking or listening skills, he/she won’t be able to strengthen your business and present it right in the market. More importantly, he/she may not be able to communicate with the customers and potential clients successfully.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">Negative Attitude</h3>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                    A person who is too proud of him/herself is not a person you need in your organization. He most likely won’t respect his/her subordinates and belittle others based on their status and position. Also, if the candidate is not “thrilled” in the interview, he/she might not work out. This will affect your work environment adversely.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3 className="mb-0">Tips To Avoid Red Flags</h3>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                    So the question that now arises is how to avoid these red flags and make the best possible selection for your company. Here is how:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>
                                        First of all, look for a candidate whose skills, education, and experience match perfectly with your job specification. An ideal candidate is neither under-qualified nor overqualified.
                                        </p></li>
                                        <li><p>
                                        Avoid the obvious questions about education etc.; you can find that on their resume. Have a deep conversation about ideas and opinions; this will show their mindset and ability to add positively to your workplace.
                                        </p></li>
                                        <li><p>
                                        Check how enthusiastic they are about your mission and how many research they have done on your company.
                                        </p></li>
                                        <li><p>
                                        Check with the references a candidate has provided. A solid reference means good working background or vice versa.
                                        </p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">Final Words</h3>
                                    <br/>
