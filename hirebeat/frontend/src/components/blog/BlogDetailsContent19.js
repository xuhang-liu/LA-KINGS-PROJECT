                                    <p>
                                    From March 2020 until today, we all are feeling the pressures of Coronavirus. It has torn apart the world we were accustomed to into pieces and every one of us burning a candle at both ends to survive this harsh new reality.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Like everything else, COVID-19 has also a huge impact on careers and jobs. As a result, to this, the perceptions and techniques of conducting job interviews have changed drastically. Nowadays most job interviews are conducted online such as Zoom, Microsoft Team platforms, and others. However, some employers and hiring managers are still inviting applicants in person for job interviews.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    The following are some pandemic-specific interview questions that are likely not going away any time soon. Many people lost their jobs in 2020 and in that year the traditional workforce changed forever. In fact, you should bear in mind three keywords when answering job interview which is as below:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>Empathy</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Adaptability</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Resilience</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">1. So, how are you coming up during this pandemic and quarantine period?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    As an applicant, it is very important that you are upfront and forthcoming. Even more important, throwback the same question to the interviewer and take the time to establish the connection with them on a deeper level.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    As being honest, there is no shame in admitting struggle, difficulty, and—to be frank—fear. However, when speaking about the struggle you are stating, ensure on highlighting how you are adapting, the steps you are taking to survive through this hard time. Take into account the power of your personal resilience—and highlight that with confidence.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">2. Have you worked remotely? What adjustments did you have to put in place to work from home?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    Many breadwinners are working from home for the first time. When answering this feel free to give a straightforward answer. For enhancing, you can explain how the switch was challenging initially—along with accommodations and modifications made to make your work from home situation effective, your career, and your home life.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    For instance, you can also mention how you set up a dedicated workspace to separate "work" life from "home" life, where you created one to one session with your managers and colleagues to address loneliness or switched the working hours to take advantage of your most productive hours. It is essential to be creative with the answer.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">3. Did COVID-19 change how perception of your career future?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    COVID-19 brought so many reforms. You need to explain to the interviewer how you faced this challenging time. For instance, if you have experience redundancy from an employer, you need to explain how that triggered into choosing the job for which you are being interviewed.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">4. How did COVID-19 impact your job search?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    It is important, to be honest. Here's the harsh truth about COVID-19. It has changed how job seekers are looking for a job—and it has changed how employers look for their employees—both in the matter of the interview and in the skills, they're looking to harness. The hiring manager is likely just as concerned as you when it comes to their own career. By answering this question honestly, a hiring manager is gaining perspective into what the <a href="/career">job search</a> looks like for candidates.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">5. Where do you foresee your career in these times?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    Try to avoid throwing your hands up in defeat when asked a question like this. Instead, explain how your industry has been affected, what you have experienced and learned about and how it is going to look in "the new normal" and how you plan to adjust to that.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">6. When working remotely, how do you effectively manage your day?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    Many companies are hiring remotely for their first time. They are building new teams–for the first time—on an entirely remote basis. Ultimately, many of these COVID-19 interview questions are actually helping them to move forward.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    As an applicant you need to let the interviewer know your best tactics for <a href="https://www.careercontessa.com/advice/workday-structure-templates/">managing your day</a> effectively, what you have learned about yourself over the past few months, and how you have been able to—or how you plan to—progress while working from home.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">7. What are your desired methods of communication when working remotely?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    This pandemic has worked best for some people and unfavorably for others. While some employees desperately want daily human connection, other more <a href="https://www.careercontessa.com/advice/introvert-in-workplace-of-extroverts/">introverted</a> employees prefer communication to be concise and less frequent.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">8. What lessons have you learned during the pandemic?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    An honest answer is appreciated here. If you learned that you are a <a href="https://www.careercontessa.com/advice/how-you-can-be-more-resilient/">resilient worker</a>, let the interviewer know. If you learned that you work best in the hours of the morning, let the interviewer know. If you learned that the pandemic has informed how vital your work is within your industry, talk about it.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">9. How do you feel about returning to work eventually?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    If you are anxious about your health, for your family, and—oh I don't know—for the entire world, be honest. Instead of saying "I don't feel comfortable returning," focus on a more positive narrative. For example, if you are uncomfortable with the idea of returning to a traditional office, explain how you have used your strengths to work effectively at home.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">10. Have you learned any new skills in the recent months?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    On one side we are all about continuing education throughout our entire career. On the other hand, surviving a pandemic is extremely stressful. So, if you have not learned any skills, no sweat. Focus instead on the new WFH skills you acquired, your productivity hacks, books you've read, or what you've learned about your own resiliency through this. It all feeds into who you are and how you process.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">COVID -19 Interview Questions you should ask your interviewer</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    First and foremost, your safety is paramount. Any organization that cannot adhere to that—especially now—is, well, not decent. Use these COVID-19-specific questions to highlight how seriously your organization is taking the pandemic, how employees have been treated through it, and how they are planning on moving forward once the workforce can "safely" return to work.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Ensure that you weigh the answers you receive. Make sure you are keeping yourself and your family safe.
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>What safety measures has the company taken to ensure that all employees are safe?</p></li>
                                        <li><p>What tools or methods of communication have you been using to work remotely?</p></li>
                                        <li><p>What does that process look like at your company?</p></li>

                                    Since the pandemic, most of the companies have adopted an online interview process to screen their candidates.
