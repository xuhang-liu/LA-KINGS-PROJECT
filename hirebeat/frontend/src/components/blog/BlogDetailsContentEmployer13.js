                                    A termination letter has to be proper for it to look professional. Following are the pointers that will help employers or HR draft the right termination letter.
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p><b>Add necessary Employee Information:</b></p><p>It is essential not to leave out employee details in this legal document. Employers must add the employee's name, company's name, and the manager they were working with. It is optional to add Employee ID, the position, and his department.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><b>Add the date of termination:</b></p><p>It is effective to eliminate the possibility of confusion by adding the termination date in the letter. It prepares the employee for the day and he wraps up all his work by that date.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><b>Provide a Reason:</b></p><p>Providing a factual explanation for termination that is clear, and to the point can help avoid the emotional setback of the employee. It is better to choose a choice of words that avoid confusion and misinterpretations at the employee’s end. It is always better to support the reason for dismissal with proofs that lead to the eventual dismissal. In any scenario, it is better to fire an employee at a good note so that he can progress further in his career without setbacks.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><b>Receipt of Company Property:</b></p><p>If the HR provided the employee with company property like a car, tablet, mobile phone, laptop, or even keys for the front door then they can claim it back if they want to. Add confirmation to the receipts of the listed items in the letter so proof of possession is established.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><b>Employee’s Final Benefits and Rights:</b></p><p>Include information regarding how benefits, compensations, and other complementarities will be affected once the employer's contract ends.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><b>Legal Agreements:</b></p><p>Employees sign some agreements when they are hired, like the Non-Disclosure Agreement. Remind the employee of the agreement through the letter. Keep a copy to yourself as well.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><b>End with a Good Note:</b></p><p>End your termination letter, not with apologies of dismissal, but with best wishes for the employee for his future endeavors.</p></li>
                                    </ul>
