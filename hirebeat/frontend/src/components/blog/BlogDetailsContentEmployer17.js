                                    <p>
                                    When it comes to hiring new staff, most employers might not even feel the need to do a proper background check on their recruits, much less arranging a proper personality assessment test, to begin with. Personality assessment is a great tool that allows you to unravel various personality-related traits of the candidates that you are about to hire.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    It provides you with factual data about every person such as what are their weak and strong points and in what section of the office, they can prove to be an asset. About 75% of all the hiring decisions end up in a miss-hire and that is a lot. To be able to reduce the chances of failure whilst hiring and cut the losses that a business is going to endure in the process (about 3.5x the employeeâ€™s annual salary) personality assessment should be a prime tool.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    It gives you a clear-cut idea of how the success rate is going to be with this specific employee in the future, makes you able to come around with better hiring decisions, and provides the employer with a clear-cut idea of how many job categories this specific employee is viable for. When you have come around the benefits of personality assessment and such, now is the time to have an understanding of various personality assessment tests that you can come around.
                                    </p>
