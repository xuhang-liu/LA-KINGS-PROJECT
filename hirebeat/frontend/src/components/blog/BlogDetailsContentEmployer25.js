                                    Campus recruitment is directly employing students and recent graduates from a college or university. Companies are spending vast amounts of money, resources, travel, and setup costs to capture the new generation of top talent. Every company wants to attract top talent, and this led to fierce competition among them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    But attracting the top talent while dealing with competitors isn't the only challenge recruiters face during campus recruitment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Here are some of the common challenges that recruiters could meet.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 className="mb-0">Challenges Recruiters Face During Campus Hiring</h3>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                    HR recruiters often struggle to find the ideal talent when they face candidates who do not have a solid foundation or the skill sets required for the position.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    And when filling an internship position, the challenge comes down to deciding what kind of assessment needs to be done.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    One of the biggest challenges is finding applicants who are natural leaders. Unfortunately, finding proactive, problem-solving, go-getter candidates isn't as easy as it sounds. According to the GradLeaders survey, 25% of campus recruiters face challenges in finding students with soft skills, while 26% of recruiters struggle to find hard skills.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    College students may not be accustomed to the changing and fast-paced culture of an organization. However, neglecting the cultural adjustment factor can again affect an organization.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Not always, the candidate with the higher IQ is the best fit. However, you can consider grades a qualification metric but must not ignore other skills and high values in candidates.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Here are four typical problems faced by companies during campus hiring.

                                    <p>
                                    It is no secret that the traditional (manual) hiring process is prolonged, inefficient. As a result, recruitment teams struggle to effectively reach and engage all the candidates present in the recruitment drive. Therefore, campus recruiters miss out on talent.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                    <p>
                                    Social media provides an additional platform for sharing and promoting jobs. With the potential to achieve higher exposure and visibility than traditional methods, it becomes a valuable asset.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Not even this, 79% of people choose to use social media for their job search. Therefore, utilizing these platforms can be helpful.

                                    <div className="article-image">
                                    <img src="https://hirebeat-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/blog-employer25-pic1.jpg" alt="Campus recruit" />

                                    Once you know what you can do, you can work on fixing it. Make sure the new system:

                                    <p>
                                    It's no secret that thousands of candidates are supposed to be screened in a campus or university recruitment drive. And screening too many candidates within a single day can be exhaustive for them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    However, most of the organizations still stick to the traditional recruitment methods such as managing paper applications. This results in a longer screening process. It is also a massive task for the campus recruiter staff, as they need to ensure that the screening is accurate and that the organization does not miss out on the best talent.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Offering the selected candidates offer letters on the same day also becomes a problem for the campus recruiters as they have to send out thousands of them without any scope of mistake. Thus, it increases the burden on the campus recruiter staff and the entire organization.

                                    <p>
                                    Having a reputable employer brand is essential to an organization's strategy as it helps companies get attention from recent graduates. So, for organizations that are still skeptical about investing in employer branding, here's why it's so important.

                                        <li><p>Your interns will become your campus ambassadors.</p></li>

                                    Many employers struggle to attract young talent. 92% of employers believe that they have a "brand problem" regarding their on-campus recruiting efforts.

                                    <p>
                                    One of the best ways to boost your employer brand among college students is to offer student internship programs or job shadowing opportunities. This way, your company will have a chance to impress young talent with your unique company culture and experienced workforce.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    When your interns return to their colleges and universities, they will serve as campus ambassadors to promote your company among other students.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Other great ways to build an employer brand that speaks to younger generations is to give exciting and inspiring classroom presentations and support student organizations' work on campus.

                                    We now live in a digital world where social media has become common, especially in the younger generation's lives. Yet, despite the digital disruption of campus hiring, many employers still use traditional recruiting methods such as paper applications and resumes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    However, these methods are no longer sufficient to recruit the best young talent as traditional recruitment methods rely heavily on human opinion, which risks unintentionally making biased recruitment decisions. Human decision-making is quite personal and can be influenced by many factors that are not relevant to the job role.
                                    </p>

                                    Consequently, it can foster a workforce that lacks diversity and differences in work styles, ideas, and perspectives. In the long run, this can be detrimental to a company's progress and productivity.

                                    If you want to be successful in recruiting the best and brightest students and recent graduates, you need to think outside of campus career fairs and post jobs on on-campus job boards.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Apply marketing strategies in your recruitment and meet students where they are on the Internet. You can also use social media to promote your brand and capture the attention of students. In addition, you should also create a particular landing page for students and recent graduates on your career website.
                                    </p>

                                    If a typical recruiter on a college campus interviewed about 350 candidates, they would have 350 applicants to track, manage, communicate, and at the same time organize the whole activity.
