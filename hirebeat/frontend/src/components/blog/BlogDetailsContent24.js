                                    Most candidates do great during the entire interview until recruiters ask, " what makes you stand out from other candidates?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    At this point, you've already answered all the common questions from your potential employers. This includes saying great things about you, such as impressive qualities and colossal experience.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    When the interview concludes, how would you answer the above question? It may not be apparent, especially if you don't know how to go about it. You'd probably, in your head, start comparing yourself with the rest of the candidates. Don't do that nor letting yourself down.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Keep in mind that the question is an opportunity to explain to the interviewer how special you are as a potential employee. How you answer it will either give you an edge or ruin your quest for the job.

                                    Whenever an interviewer asks you this question, you should know they want to hear about the unique abilities you'll bring to the company. You should explain how your strengths and experience can benefit the hiring company. This is the time to prove yourself as the perfect candidate for the job and not any other person.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Companies have issues that need to be solved. As you answer the question, you should show them you're a better problem solver.

                                        <strong>Research the job requirements: </strong>
                                        You should develop a list of job requirements included in the employer's job posting. Also, create a list of your qualifications, skills, experience level. Compare your strengths with the requirements for the job. This should form a basis for the answer you're likely to provide for this question. Besides, you should include your impressive accomplishments relevant to the job. Use unique examples that will enable you to outdo your competitors.
